## üöÄ Usage

**1. Start the Application**  
Run the following command to launch the GUI:

```bash
python -m cellsepi
```

**Interface Overview**  
*(Left: Start Screen; Right: Main Interface with Images)*

  <img src="docs/images/main_window_with_images.png" width="400" alt="Main Window with Images"/>
</p>

**Options**  
- The dark/light theme adapts to your system settings. Changing the theme is only for the current session. 
- Mask and outline colors are saved in the configuration file for consistency.

**Profiles**  
Save and manage parameters like the bright-field channel, channel prefix, mask suffix, and diameter.

**Segmentation**  
To start segmentation, select:
- A Lif or Tif file
- A compatible model

If you see:
```text
You have selected an incompatible file for the segmentation model.
```
It means the chosen model isn‚Äôt compatible with Cellpose‚Äôs segmentation process.

During segmentation, you can:
- **Pause:** Temporarily halt the process (useful for large images) and resume later.
- **Cancel:** Abort the process, reverting to the previous mask or removing it if none existed.

**Readout**  
Generates an `.xlsx` file containing extracted fluorescence values. Click the "Open Excel" button to launch your system‚Äôs default spreadsheet application (e.g., ONLYOFFICE).

**Drawing Tools**  
Correct segmentation errors manually or draw masks to train new models.  
- **Cell ID Shifting:** Automatically adjusts mask IDs to maintain a continuous sequence when a mask is deleted.

All changes in the Drawing Tools window are synchronized in real time with the main window.

**Training**  
Train your own models using the **Cellpose** framework. Two training modes are available:
1. **New Model Training:** Train a model from scratch using standard Cellpose models (e.g., `nuclei`, `cyto`, `cyto2`, `cyto3`).
2. **Model Fine-Tuning:** Retrain an existing model with your own images and masks for improved performance.
